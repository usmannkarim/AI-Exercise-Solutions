Cabinets and Boxes are objects that are mostly in cubic shape. Make a program that takes inputs like height, width and depth from user and then calculate volume of the cube:

"volume = height ∗ width ∗ depth"

After calculating volume of cube, compare it with following ranges and print the relevant label:

Volume Range       Label
1 cm3 – 10 cm3	 Extra Small
11 cm3 – 25 cm3	 Small
26 cm3 – 75 cm3	 Medium
76 cm3 – 100 cm3	 Large
101 cm3 – 250 cm3	 Extra Large
251 cm3 and above	 Extra-Extra Large
