# Exercise Python input /output Basic operations (cont..):
# Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.
Formula: c/5 = f-32/9 Expected Output:
Enter temp in Celsius: 60Â°C Temperature in Fahrenheit is :140

# Explanation of the code:

1. Define two functions celsius_to_fahrenheit and fahrenheit_to_celsius to perform the conversions.

2. Get the temperature and the scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit) as input from the user using the input function.

3. Check the scale using an if statement and perform the appropriate conversion by calling the corresponding function.

4. If the scale entered by the user is neither "celsius" nor "fahrenheit", print an error message.

5. Finally, print the result of the conversion.
