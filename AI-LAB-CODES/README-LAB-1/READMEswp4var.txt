# Exercise Python input /output Basic operations:
# Write a Python program to swap 4 variables values (input four values.Sample input: Before swapping a=2, b=56, c=78, d=9

# Explanation of the code:

1. Input values for the 4 variables a, b, c, and d using the input function.

2. Store the value of a in a temporary variable temp.

3. Swap the value of a with d by assigning the value of d to a.

4. Swap the value of d with the value stored in the temporary variable temp by assigning the value of temp to d.

5. Similarly, store the value of b in a temporary variable temp.

6. Swap the value of b with c by assigning the value of c to b.

7. Swap the value of c with the value stored in the temporary variable temp by assigning the value of temp to c.

8. Finally, print the values of the 4 variables after the swap using the print function.
