This repository contains six Python programs that demonstrate various concepts in Python. Here's a brief overview of each program:

Lambda Functions to Square and Cube Every Number in a List: This program 'square_and_cube.py' uses lambda functions to square and cube every number in a given list of integers.

Lambda Function to Check if a String Starts with a Given Character: This program 'starts_with.py' uses lambda functions to check if a given string starts with a given character.

Lambda Function to Extract Year, Month, Date, and Time: This program 'extract_datetime.py' uses lambda functions to extract the year, month, date, and time from a given string.

Store City Information in a File: This program 'filewriting1.py' collects information about cities in a province, including their name, population, and mayor, and stores the data in a file. Also this program prompts the user to enter information for a number of cities and stores the data in a file in the order in which it was entered.

Create and Append a Message to a Data File: This program 'filewriting2.py' creates a data file called student.txt and appends the message "Now we are AI students" to the file.
